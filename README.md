# Calculator
This application was designed and developed as an assignment for the course CS 2S03 - Principles of Programming. The purpose of the assignment was to implement the core of a calculator application, which can deal with both integer and floating-point numbers as well as create a GUI frontend for the application. The assignment also included a testing portion (TestingA5.java), done using the JUnit 4 framework.
